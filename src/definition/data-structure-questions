Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?

what is an Array?
An Array is a memory location that contains different variable of the same sort instead of creating
several variables / An Array is a variable that can contain several values at the same time.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?

what is LinkedList?
The LinkedList is a collection/storage which can contain several objects of the same type.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
An Array is a collection of objects of the same type; LinkedList is a collection of objects (nodes)
that consist of 2 parts: data and address. The Array elements/objects are independent of each other;
LinkedList elements/objects depend on each other since they contain address of the other node.
It is easier to access Array by using index; accessing elements in LinkedList is slower since it
starts from the first element.

what is queue?
Queue interface is used to hold the elements that are about to be processed in FIFO (First In First
 Out) order.

what is stack?
Stack is a data structure that is based on LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. The basic operations
 are push and pop along with empty, search and peek. Push operation adds an element at the top of
 the stack and the pop operation removes an element from the top of the stack.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
what is the order of complexity?
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?

what is tree in data structure?
A tree is a data structure that represents the hierarchical data. The root is at the top and the
branches are moving in a downward direction. A tree data structure is defined as a collection of
objects known as nodes that are linked together to represent or simulate hierarchy. It is a
non-linear data structure because it is not stored in a sequential manner. The data can be of any
type. Each node contains some data and the link/reference of other nodes can be called children.

what is graph in data structure?
A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are referred to as
vertices and the edges are the lines/arcs that connect any two nodes of the graph.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
In HashMap no method is synchronized, in HashTable every method is synchronized; in HashMap threads
are not required to wait and thus, the performance is high while HashTable increases the waiting time
and the performance is slow. In HashMap the Null is allowed while it is not allowed in HashTable.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
HashMap uses multiple buckets and each bucket point to a Singly Linked List where the entries
(nodes) are stored. Once the bucket is identified by the hash function using hashcode, the
hashCode is used to check if there is already a key with the same hashCode or not in the
bucket.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?

What is DFS and BFS?
DFS stands for Depth First Search and it uses Stack data structure. BFS stands for Breadth
First Search and Queue data structure is used.

What is Recursion?
Recursion is a process in which a method calls itself continuously.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every element
is attached to its previous and next adjacent.
In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in a hierarchically manner.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
